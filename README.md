# Water-Quality-Monitoring-System-For-Lobster-Pond-Embedded-Part
Embedded part for my Final Year Project which is "Water Quality Monitoring System for Lobster Pond"

### Problem Statement
Although lobster farming has been rapidly growing for decades, there are still 
problems that needed to be addressed. Poor water quality due to cultivators’ lack of 
experience and education has been one of the many reasons why the potential growth 
and breeding of lobsters are restrained [3]. Maintaining the lobster farm without proper 
knowledge can lead to the mortality of the lobsters. Water conditions of lobster habitats 
have these thresholds that must be maintained to ensure the ecosystem remains stable 
as lobsters are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, including pH, 
water temperature, and oxygen [4]. These environmental changes can affect the 
lobster's lifetime, as well as its hunger, disease vulnerability, and cannibalism. Unusual 
monitoring of the water quality would cause the loss of the lobsters’ life. Other than 
that, farmers are not as sensitive as lobsters when environmental elements change [4]. 
They could not use their five senses to directly measure the critical parameter in water. 
Hence, they need cultivation equipment and chemical test kits to monitor the water 
quality. However, using chemical test kits is still considered as the old and traditional 
method.
Implementing the traditional method where farmers use the cultivation kit and 
equipment, and measure the water quality manually is very inefficient [5]. Since water 
quality needs to be monitored regularly, the manual operation takes a lot of time for 
cultivators to do every day. It also costs more when farmers need to collect and send 
the water sample to a laboratory to be tested. Water testing should be done regularly 
to ensure that the water quality is maintained for a high yield, as well as the health and 
safety of the aquatic life [5].
